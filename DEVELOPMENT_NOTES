1. Please always fix dependency versions in POMs, so you will avoid dependency conflicts during development
2. Use dependencyManagement sections and BOMs, use managed versions in child POMs (please google about dependencyManagement)
3. Use Unix/Linux-style line endings in git (# git config --global core.autocrlf true)
